# saint-laurent

Saint-Laurent is a small web app showing the next bus departures at Saint-Laurent station, Rennes, France.

My goal is to:
- have fun with [Go](http://golang.org/) and [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/)
- have fun with [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/) and [Web Components](http://webcomponents.org/)
- have fun with Keolis Rennes API and open Data
