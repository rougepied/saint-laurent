# saint-laurent

Saint-Laurent is a small web app showing the next bus departures at Saint-Laurent station, Rennes, France.F

My goal is to have fun with:
- [Go](http://golang.org/) and [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/)
- [Web Components](http://webcomponents.org/) written in [ES2015](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/)
- [Web Components](http://webcomponents.org/) written in [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/)
- Keolis Rennes API and open data
